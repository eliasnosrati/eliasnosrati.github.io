<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">I am a social scientist working at the University of Oslo and at Fafo Institute for Labour and Social Research. Prior to returning to Oslo, I trained in social, political, and economic sciences at the University of Cambridge (PhD, 2019) and was a Junior Research Fellow at the University of Oxford (2019–2022). My principal research interests are in social inequality and public policy. The bulk of my published work is concerned with the institutional determinants of unequal life chances. My ongoing work is concerned with the political economy of fiscal and monetary policy, with a special focus on policies that are both inequality-reducing and efficiency-enhancing. I am also interested in developing tractable formal models that combine insights from different disiplines to connect theory and data in novel ways. </span></p>
