<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">My research is concerned with the political economy of unequal life chances, by which I mean socially sanctioned disparities in human capabilities to function and flourish. To date, I have investigated the distributional consequences of various public policy repertoires, from hyper-incarceration in the Global North to structural adjustment in the Global South. My current research agenda is centred around (<em>a</em>) a global comparative history of vital inequality in the modern era, (<em>b</em>) the development of statistical methods for the identification of heterogeneous causal effects in the social sciences and beyond, and (<em>c</em>) the integration of social and biological frameworks in the study of population health and complex traits.</span></p>
